Arguing with him is just a waste of time and overall a bad experience. I am tired of this shit. How can he say I only come around him when I need something. I am just sick and tired of hearing things like that. It is just untrue and a lie. That is a mean thing to say and I will not understand it."))

I got my project finished, well... most of it. I am pretty happy with the results and excited to almost be finished with this semester. Overall, the semester has went well and I am excited to start a real job soon."))
