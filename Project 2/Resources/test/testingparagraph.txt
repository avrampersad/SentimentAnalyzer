My day has been terrible. I cannot believe that this day is turning out so bad. I don't get why my dad is so arrogant and angry all the time. Arguing with him is just a waste of time and overall a bad experience. I am tired of this shit. How can he say I only come around him when I need something. I am just sick and tired of hearing things like that. It is just untrue and a lie. That is a mean thing to say and I will not understand it.
